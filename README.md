# Crowdfunding Contract
A smart contract for crowdfunding.

The owner (deployer) can create and end the campaign at a specific time. The owner also sets a goal for the amount that will be reached.
Users can pledge their tokens after the campaign is started.

If the goal is reached, the owner can claim tokens from the contract.
If the goal is not reached, users can take refunds.
